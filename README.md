# Optical-Mark-Recognition-Android

OMR Scanner android app made using OpenCV Android SDK capable of recognising simple omr sheet bubbles and generate the result using an answer key.

### Uses OpenCV contour detection and Image Processing to recognise darkened bubbles and prints the recognised answers with 95-100% accuracy.
### Takes an image of the OMR sheets and gives an option to crop it to make it fit the given discription and also to remove background noise.
### Saves it and then scans it using OpenCV and saves the results in a file which can then be checked with an answer key that was added prior to the scan.
### Can save an answer key and also modify existing ones within the app.
